            <p>You had a run-in with the criminal system. You may have a criminal record and it may
                be preventing you from bettering your life. </p>
            <p>However, you can do something about it. </p>
            If you meet certain requirements, you can get your criminal record erased through a process called
            expungement. ExpungeMaryland.org is a free online tool which helps determine, through a few simple
            questions, if your record can be expunged. The tool also suggests next steps which often include
            working with a lawyer.
            <p>The entire online review takes less than 5 minutes. Letâ€™s get started!</p>

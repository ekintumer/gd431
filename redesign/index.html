            <p>You had a run-in with the criminal system. You may have a criminal record and it may be preventing you
                from
                bettering
                your life. <br>
                However, you can do something about it. <br>
                If you meet certain requirements, you can get your criminal record erased through a process called
                expungement.
                ExpungeMaryland.org is a free online tool which helps determine, through a few simple questions, if
                your
                record can be
                expunged. The tool also suggests next steps which often include working with a lawyer.<br>
                The entire online review takes less than 5 minutes. Letâ€™s get started!</p>
